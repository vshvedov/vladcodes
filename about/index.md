Hello, I'm [Vlad Shvedov](/assets/img/about/me.jpeg)! I'm Software Engineer. I started programming when I was 10 on my ZX Spectrum 16K clone. Basic and then Zilog Z80 Assembler on ZX 128K. I spent most of the middle school learning Borland Pascal and OOP on my Intel 80386 SX PC, helping my Dad with scientific calculations and artificial life simulators (as I was sure I'll be a microbiologist). In high school, I found FIDO and had my own BBS with home-brew software running while keep programming and learning Economics in University, until I finally got unlimited access to the Internet. Here is my story, as of Web Developer begins, as I discovered Perl and CGI programming.

My current scope of interests is closely connected with self-generative systems, Natural Language Processing, distributed Web Applications development, CNC (I made the electronics for [my CNC milling machine](/assets/img/about/cnc.jpeg)) and woodworking (most of all I'm interested in making [electric guitars](/assets/img/about/tele.jpeg)).

Music is a big part of my life. I'm not playing in any band anymore, however I have some [music projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE3Yqnbgb18), and I'm highly interested in sound synthesis, Eurorack, and modular synths and music making software development.

For web using Ruby/Rails, Arduino C/C++ and Python for [electronics prototyping](/assets/img/about/device.jpeg) and Flutter for mobile apps. I'm also using Fusion360 for all CNC and 3D printing.

Recently, my [wife](https://opacity.one) and I have started developing an interactive encyclopedia for kids and their parents.
