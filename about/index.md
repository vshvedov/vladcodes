Hello, I'm [Vlad Shvedov](/assets/img/about/me.jpeg)! I'm Software Engineer. I started with programming from ZX's Basic and then Zilog Z80 Assembler,
then spent most of the middle school with Borland Pascal helping my Dad with scientific calculations and artificial life simulators (as I was sure I'll be a microbiologist). In high school, I found FIDO and had my own BBS with custom software running while in Univercity, until I finally got unlimited access to the Internet. Here is my story, as of Web Developer starts.

My current scope of interests is closely connected with self-generative systems programming, distributed web applications development, and CNC (I made the electronics for [my CNC milling machine](/assets/img/about/cnc.jpeg)) and woodworking (most of all I'm interested in making [electric guitars](/assets/img/about/tele.jpeg)).

I'm not playing in any band anymore; however I have some [music projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE3Yqnbgb18), and I'm highly interested in sound synthesis, Eurorack, and modular synths, both hardware and software.

For software development, I'm using Ruby and Elixir for Web, Arduino C/C++ for [electronics prototyping](/assets/img/about/device.jpeg) and Lua for Web and (more or less) Desktop apps. I'm using Fusion360 for all CNC.
