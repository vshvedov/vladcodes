## Introduction

Hello, I'm [Vlad Shvedov](/assets/img/about/me.jpeg)! I'm Software Engineer. I started programming on my ZX Spectrum 16K clone when I was 10. First, BASIC and then Zilog Z80's Assembler. I spent most of the middle school learning Borland Pascal and OOP on my Intel 80386 SX PC, helping my Dad with scientific calculations and working on an artificial life simulators (as I was sure I'll be a microbiologist). In high school, I found FIDO and had my own BBS with home-brew software running, and kept programming and learning Economics in University, until I finally got unlimited access to the Internet. Here is my story, as of Web Developer begins, as I discovered Perl and CGI.

My current scope of interests is closely connected to generative systems, distributed and reactive Web Applications development, FDM and SLA 3D Printing, CNC (I made the electronics for [my CNC milling machine](/assets/img/about/cnc.jpeg)) and woodworking (most of all I'm interested in making [electric guitars](/assets/img/about/tele.jpeg)).

Music is a big part of my life. I'm not playing in any band anymore, however I have some [music projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE3Yqnbgb18), and I'm very interested in sound synthesis, old-school CASIO and modulkar synths and Eurorack.

For everything Web I'm using Ruby/Rails (it's still the best technology for the monolyth web apps). Arduino, C/C++ and Python for [electronics prototyping](/assets/img/about/device.jpeg) and Flutter for mobile apps. I'm also using Fusion360 and Blender for CNC and 3D printing.

## Bio for the Press

Vlad has been involved in software development from a young age, having
initially taught himself low-level programming for gaming as well as assisting
his Father in scientific calculations automation since the age of 13.
Vlad graduated from the University of G. E. Weinstein's in applied Economics
and Management. 
During his final year of his Master’s Vlad won the ‘Innovation
Award’ for his final project, combining his Economic Science and programming
experience, by developing an HR management and prediction platform for a
local food factory.

Vlad started his career at Masquerade, a games development studio. Here he
was quickly promoted, managing a team, as well as being the lead developer.
Masquerade inspired Vlad to set up his own company, co-founding a Video on
Demand platform, where he held the role of CTO. It was during this venture he
developed a deep interest in machine-based algorithmic suggestions, based on
user's interests, from user viewings data and Facebook data. Vlad’s hard work
had paid off and his VoD company was acquired by a major digital rights owner
and is still the underlying technology powering it today.

Following on from this success, Vlad advised several Silicon Valley startups
including his assistance at DataXu and developing the core of Toptal, as the
company’s employee number one.

His main area of specializing was next-generation advertising platforms
developing, Rails-based platform architecturing and developers teams leading.
During this period he also developed highload experience in TOP1 (by Alexa
rate) gaming portal Y8.com.

In 2012, Vlad became a Director of Engineering at Helios Technologies. Here he
built the team from scratch in Odessa and continued his team leading on
projects such as ID.net (inetidetity and secure payments platform),
TrafficFactory (analytical and advertisement platform) and Ant.com (a
social-based search engine with a Natural Language Processing and social
graph exploration core).

In 2014, Vlad joined ProFinda as he was excited about the ability to use AI to
help companies be more efficient. Here he leads the development work
combining Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine
Learning and Algorithmic Suggestions. Vlad’s goal is to achieve the state of
when the whole Intelligence stack is acting as a set of fault-tolerant and
independent applications, with an ability to add new entities, data and
knowledge, to improve the final result of machine-based expertise ad hoc. He
leads a team of data engineers and is responsible for full cycle development and
researchers.

In 2016, Vlad joined Labrador OmniMedia, as a Lead Raild Developer to work on
TastevinApp - a software dedicated to re-inventing on-premise beverage sales
and integrate client’s Point of Sale terminals with client-faced iOS software
