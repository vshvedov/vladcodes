      Vlad has been involved in software development from a young age, having
      initially taught himself low-level programming for gaming as well as assisting
      his Father in scientific calculations automation since the age of 13.
      Vlad graduated from the University of G. E. Weinstein's in applied Economics
      and Management. During his final year of his Master’s Vlad won the ‘Innovation
      Award’ for his final project, combining his Economic Science and programming
      experience, by developing an HR management and prediction platform for a
      local food factory.
      Vlad started his career at Masquerade, a games development studio. Here he
      was quickly promoted, managing a team, as well as being the lead developer.
      Masquerade inspired Vlad to set up his own company, co-founding a Video on
      Demand platform, where he held the role of CTO. It was during this venture he
      developed a deep interest in machine-based algorithmic suggestions, based on
      user's interests, from user viewings data and Facebook data. Vlad’s hard work
      had paid off and his VoD company was acquired by a major digital rights owner
      and is still the underlying technology powering it today.
      Following on from this success, Vlad advised several Silicon Valley startups
      including his assistance at DataXu and developing the core of Toptal, as the
      company’s employee number one.
      His main area of specializing was next-generation advertising platforms
      developing, Rails-based platform architecturing and developers teams leading.
      During this period he also developed highload experience in TOP1 (by Alexa
      rate) gaming portal Y8.com.
      In 2012, Vlad became a Director of Engineering at Helios Technologies. Here he
      built the team from scratch in Odessa and continued his team leading on
      projects such as ID.net (inetidetity and secure payments platform),
      TrafficFactory (analytical and advertisement platform) and Ant.com (a
      social-based search engine with a Natural Language Processing and social
      graph exploration core).
      In 2014, Vlad joined ProFinda as he was excited about the ability to use AI to
      help companies be more efficient. Here he leads the development work
      combining Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine
      Learning and Algorithmic Suggestions. Vlad’s goal is to achieve the state of
      when the whole Intelligence stack is acting as a set of fault-tolerant and
      independent applications, with an ability to add new entities, data and
      knowledge, to improve the final result of machine-based expertise ad hoc. He
      leads a team of data engineers and is responsible for full cycle development and
      researchers.
      In 2016, Vlad joined Labrador OmniMedia, as a Lead Raild Developer to work on
      TastevinApp - a software dedicated to re-inventing on-premise beverage sales
      and integrate client’s Point of Sale terminals with client-faced iOS software
